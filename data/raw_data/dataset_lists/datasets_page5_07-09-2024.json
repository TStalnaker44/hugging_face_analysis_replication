All copyrights of the data belong\n    to healthcaremagic.com and icliniq.com.\"\n\n    The following is an example from the healthcaremagic.com subset:\n\n    Patient: I get cramps on top of my left forearm and hand and it causes my hand and fingers to draw up and it\n    hurts. It mainly does this when I bend my arm. I ve been told that I have a slight pinch in a nerve in my neck.\n    Could this be a cause? I don t think so. Doctor: Hi there. It may sound difficult to believe it ,but the nerves\n    which supply your forearms and hand, start at the level of spinal cord and on their way towards the forearm and\n    hand regions which they supply, the course of these nerves pass through difference fascial and muscular planes\n    that can make them susceptible to entrapment neuropathies. Its a group of conditions where a nerve gets\n    compressed between a muscle and a bone, or between the fibers of a muscle that it pierces or passes through.\n    Also, the compression can happen when the nerves are travelling around a blood vessel which can mechanically put\n    pressure on them. Usually patients who would be having such a problem present with a dull aching pain over the\n    arm and forearm. If it is not too severe and does not cause any neurological deficits then conservative management\n    with Pregabalin and Vitamin B complex tablets, activity modifications and physiotherapy can be started which\n    will provide relief. Avoid the activities which exaggerate your problem.\n\n    Could painful forearms be related to pinched nerve in neck?\n\n\n    The following is an example from the icliniq.com subset:\n\n    Patient: Hello doctor,  We are looking for a second opinion on my friend's MRI scan of both the knee joints as he\n    is experiencing excruciating pain just above the patella. He has a sudden onset of severe pain on both the knee\n    joints about two weeks ago. Previously he had a similar episode about two to three months ago and it subsided\n    after resting and painkillers. Doctor: Hi. I viewed the right and left knee MRI images. (attachment removed to\n    protect patient identity).  Left knee: The MRI, left knee joint shows a complex tear in the posterior horn of the\n    medial meniscus area and mild left knee joint effusion. There is some fluid between the semimembranous and medial\n    head of gastrocnemius muscles. There is a small area of focal cartilage defect in the upper pole of the patella\n    with mild edematous fat. The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are normal. The medial and lateral\n    collateral ligaments are normal. Right knee: The right knee joint shows mild increased signal intensity in the\n    posterior horn of the medial meniscus area and minimal knee joint effusion. There is minimal fluid in the back\n    of the lower thigh and not significant. There is a suspicious strain in the left anterior cruciate ligament\n    interiorly but largely the attachments are normal. The posterior cruciate ligament is normal. There are subtle\n    changes in the upper pole area of the right patella and mild edema. There is mild edema around the bilateral\n    distal quadriceps tendons, but there is no obvious tear of the tendons.\n\n    My friend has excruciating knee pain.

Previous research has focused on developing labeled and unlabeled corpora for these languages through online scraping and document translation. While these methods have proven effective and cost-efficient, we have identified limitations in the resulting corpora, including a lack of lexical diversity and cultural relevance to local communities. To address this gap, we conduct a case study on Indonesian local languages. We compare the effectiveness of online scraping, human translation, and paragraph writing by native speakers in constructing datasets. Our findings demonstrate that datasets generated through paragraph writing by native speakers exhibit superior quality in terms of lexical diversity and cultural content. In addition, we present the NusaWrites benchmark, encompassing 12 underrepresented and extremely low-resource languages spoken by millions of individuals in Indonesia. Our empirical experiment results using existing multilingual large language models conclude the need to extend these models to more underrepresented languages.\nWe introduce a novel high quality human curated corpora, i.e., NusaMenulis, which covers 12 languages spoken in Indonesia. The resource extend the coverage of languages to 5 new languages, i.e., Ambon (abs), Bima (bhp), Makassarese (mak), Palembang / Musi (mui), and Rejang (rej).\nFor the topic modeling task, we cover 8 topics, i.e., food \\& beverages, sports, leisure, religion, culture \\& heritage, a slice of life, technology, and business.", "downloads": 177, "tags": ["language:btk", "language:bew", "language:bug", "language:jav", "language:mad", "language:mak", "language:min", "language:mui", "language:rej", "language:sun", "arxiv:2406.10118", "region:us", "topic-modeling"], "createdAt": "2023-09-26T11:17:48.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "65ab047348c718a57441ab24", "id": "Etienne-David/GlobalWheatHeadDataset2021", "author": "Etienne-David", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-01-19T23:27:41.000Z", "likes": 3, "private": false, "sha": "d223a227ee21fca3dbab9605d3fbcdcc2e33abc5", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for \"Global Wheat Head Dataset 2021\" \ud83d\ude0a\n\t\n\nIf you want any update on the Global Wheat Dataset Community, go on https://www.global-wheat.com/\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIntroduction\n\t\n\nWheat is essential for a large part of humanity.

This dataset is made up of scientific articles that were automatically converted from PDF format to plain text and thus require careful preprocessing so that irrevelant spans of text do not negatively affect keyphrase extraction performance. In previous work, a wide range of document preprocessing techniques were described but their impact on the overall performance of keyphrase extraction models is still unexplored.

This paper describes the visual analysis of such chapbook illustrations. We automatically extract all the illustrations contained in the National Library of Scotland Chapbooks Printed in Scotland dataset, and create a visual search engine to search this dataset using full or part-illustrations as queries. We also cluster these illustrations based on their visual content, and provide keyword-based search of the metadata associated with each publication. The visual search; clustering of illustrations based on visual content; and metadata search features enable researchers to forensically analyse the chapbooks dataset and to discover unnoticed relationships between its elements.

For details of the \noriginal TACRED's data collection and annotation process, see the Stanford paper (https://aclanthology.org/D17-1004/). \nTranslations are syntactically validated by checking the correctness of the XML tag markup. Any translations with an \ninvalid tag structure, e.g. missing or invalid head or tail tag pairs, are discarded (on average, 2.3% of the \ninstances).\n\nLanguages covered are: Arabic, Chinese, Finnish, French, German, Hindi, Hungarian, Japanese, Polish,\n Russian, Spanish, Turkish. Intended use is supervised relation classification. Audience - researchers.\n\n Please see our ACL paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04582) for full details.\n\nNOTE: This Datasetreader supports a reduced version of the original TACRED JSON format with the following changes:\n- Removed fields: stanford_pos, stanford_ner, stanford_head, stanford_deprel, docid\nThe motivation for this is that we want to support additional languages, for which these fields were not required\nor available. The reader expects the specification of a language-specific configuration specifying the variant\n(original, revisited or retacred) and the language (as a two-letter iso code).\n\nThe DatasetReader changes the offsets of the following fields, to conform with standard Python usage (see\n_generate_examples()):\n- subj_end to subj_end + 1 (make end offset exclusive)\n- obj_end to obj_end + 1 (make end offset exclusive)\n\nNOTE 2: The MultiTACRED dataset offers an additional 'split', namely the backtranslated test data (translated to a\ntarget language and then back to English).
