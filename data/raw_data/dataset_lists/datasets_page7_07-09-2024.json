The paradigm\npretrains a shared model on large volumes of unlabeled data and achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for various tasks with minimal adaptation. However, the\nspeech processing community lacks a similar setup to systematically explore the\nparadigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce Speech processing Universal\nPERformance Benchmark (SUPERB). SUPERB is a leaderboard to benchmark the\nperformance of a shared model across a wide range of speech processing tasks\nwith minimal architecture changes and labeled data. Among multiple usages of the\nshared model, we especially focus on extracting the representation learned from\nSSL due to its preferable re-usability. We present a simple framework to solve\nSUPERB tasks by learning task-specialized lightweight prediction heads on top of\nthe frozen shared model.

AI systems that can create programs as solutions to problems or assist developers in writing programs can increase productivity and make programming more accessible. Recently, pre-trained large language models have shown impressive abilities in generating new codes from natural language descriptions, repairing buggy codes, translating codes between languages, and retrieving relevant code segments. However, the evaluation of these models has often been performed in a scattered way on only one or two specific tasks, in a few languages, at a partial granularity (e.g., function) level and in many cases without proper training data. Even more concerning is that in most cases the evaluation of generated codes has been done in terms of mere lexical overlap rather than actual execution whereas semantic similarity (or equivalence) of two code segments depends only on their ``execution similarity'', i.e., being able to get the same output for a given input.", "downloads": 120, "tags": ["task_categories:translation", "task_categories:token-classification", "task_categories:text2text-generation", "task_categories:text-retrieval", "task_categories:text-generation", "task_categories:text-classification", "task_categories:feature-extraction", "task_categories:question-answering", "annotations_creators:expert-generated", "language_creators:found", "language_creators:expert-generated", "multilinguality:multilingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:code", "language:en", "license:cc-by-nc-4.0", "size_categories:1M<n<10M", "arxiv:2303.03004", "region:us", "programming-language", "code", "program-synthesis", "automatic-code-repair", "code-retrieval", "code-translation", "code-classification"], "createdAt": "2023-04-09T11:02:35.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "6463ba5f76155a231c817f47", "id": "JasperLS/prompt-injections", "author": "JasperLS", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-05-16T17:16:21.000Z", "likes": 15, "private": false, "sha": "9f62f4a9788f030e52fe85a816b338f507c48187", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for \"deberta-v3-base-injection-dataset\"\n\t\n\nMore Information needed\n", "downloads": 120, "tags": ["size_categories:n<1K", "format:parquet", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:pandas", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-05-16T17:16:15.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "64dfbc78d646147f303c8113", "id": "open-llm-leaderboard-old/details_CalderaAI__30B-Epsilon", "author": "open-llm-leaderboard-old", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-12-02T15:01:16.000Z", "likes": 0, "private": false, "sha": "47294c6e198e0f3085d802e3aa3af20bd3dddb12", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for Evaluation run of CalderaAI/30B-Epsilon\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Summary\n\t\n\nDataset automatically created during the evaluation run of model CalderaAI/30B-Epsilon on the Open LLM Leaderboard.\nThe dataset is composed of 64 configuration, each one coresponding to one of the evaluated task.\nThe dataset has been created from 4 run(s).

However, less work has been done on multilingual text simplification due to the lack of a diverse evaluation benchmark that covers complex-simple sentence pairs in many languages. This paper introduces the MultiSim benchmark, a collection of 27 resources in 12 distinct languages containing over 1.7 million complex-simple sentence pairs. This benchmark will encourage research in developing more effective multilingual text simplification models and evaluation metrics. Our experiments using MultiSim with pre-trained multilingual language models reveal exciting performance improvements from multilingual training in non-English settings. We observe strong performance from Russian in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to low-resource languages. We further show that few-shot prompting with BLOOM-176b achieves comparable quality to reference simplifications outperforming fine-tuned models in most languages. We validate these findings through human evaluation.\",\n}", "description": "MultiSim is a growing collection of Text Simplfication datasets in multiple languages.

Previous research has focused on developing labeled and unlabeled corpora for these languages through online scraping and document translation. While these methods have proven effective and cost-efficient, we have identified limitations in the resulting corpora, including a lack of lexical diversity and cultural relevance to local communities. To address this gap, we conduct a case study on Indonesian local languages. We compare the effectiveness of online scraping, human translation, and paragraph writing by native speakers in constructing datasets. Our findings demonstrate that datasets generated through paragraph writing by native speakers exhibit superior quality in terms of lexical diversity and cultural content. In addition, we present the NusaWrites benchmark, encompassing 12 underrepresented and extremely low-resource languages spoken by millions of individuals in Indonesia.

With the recent availability of public, large ground-truth datasets such as PubLayNet and DocBank, deep-learning models have proven to be very effective at layout detection and segmentation. While these datasets are of adequate size to train such models, they severely lack in layout variability since they are sourced from scientific article repositories such as PubMed and arXiv only. Consequently, the accuracy of the layout segmentation drops significantly when these models are applied on more challenging and diverse layouts. In this paper, we present \\textit{DocLayNet}, a new, publicly available, document-layout annotation dataset in COCO format. It contains 80863 manually annotated pages from diverse data sources to represent a wide variability in layouts. For each PDF page, the layout annotations provide labelled bounding-boxes with a choice of 11 distinct classes. DocLayNet also provides a subset of double- and triple-annotated pages to determine the inter-annotator agreement. In multiple experiments, we provide smallline accuracy scores (in mAP) for a set of popular object detection models. We also demonstrate that these models fall approximately 10\\% behind the inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, we provide evidence that DocLayNet is of sufficient size. Lastly, we compare models trained on PubLayNet, DocBank and DocLayNet, showing that layout predictions of the DocLayNet-trained models are more robust and thus the preferred choice for general-purpose document-layout analysis.", "downloads": 114, "tags": ["task_categories:object-detection", "task_categories:image-segmentation", "task_categories:token-classification", "task_ids:instance-segmentation", "annotations_creators:crowdsourced", "language:en", "language:de", "language:fr", "language:ja", "license:other", "size_categories:1K<n<10K", "modality:image", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:mlcroissant", "arxiv:2206.01062", "region:us", "DocLayNet", "COCO", "PDF", "IBM", "Financial-Reports", "Finance", "Manuals", "Scientific-Articles", "Science", "Laws", "Law", "Regulations", "Patents", "Government-Tenders", "object-detection", "image-segmentation", "token-classification", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-01-25T17:53:26.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "641b2fe95d107c5c5f3b4aa1", "id": "cambridgeltl/vsr_zeroshot", "author": "cambridgeltl", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-03-22T17:27:58.000Z", "likes": 1, "private": false, "sha": "148b3777ceef4a1bfe46377614980836db7d12f2", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tVSR: Visual Spatial Reasoning\n\t\n\nThis is the zero-shot set of VSR: Visual Spatial Reasoning (TACL 2023) [paper].\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tUsage\n\t\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\ndata_files = {\"train\": \"train.jsonl\", \"dev\": \"dev.jsonl\", \"test\": \"test.jsonl\"}\ndataset = load_dataset(\"cambridgeltl/vsr_zeroshot\", data_files=data_files)\n\nNote that the image files still need to be downloaded separately.

However, most of these large raw corpora are either available only for English or not available to the general public due to copyright issues. Nevertheless, there are some examples of freely available multilingual corpora for training Deep Learning NLP models, such as the OSCAR and Paracrawl corpora. However, they have quality issues, especially for low-resource languages. Moreover, recreating or updating these corpora is very complex. In this work, we try to reproduce and improve the goclassy pipeline used to create the OSCAR corpus. We propose a new pipeline that is faster, modular, parameterizable, and well documented. We use it to create a corpus similar to OSCAR but larger and based on recent data. Also, unlike OSCAR, the metadata information is at the document level. We release our pipeline under an open source license and publish the corpus under a research-only license.},\n  language  = {en}\n}\n@article{kreutzer-etal-2022-quality,\n    title = \"Quality at a Glance: An Audit of Web-Crawled Multilingual Datasets\",\n    author = {Kreutzer, Julia  and\n      Caswell, Isaac  and\n      Wang, Lisa  and\n      Wahab, Ahsan  and\n      van Esch, Daan  and\n      Ulzii-Orshikh, Nasanbayar  and\n      Tapo, Allahsera  and\n      Subramani, Nishant  and\n      Sokolov, Artem  and\n      Sikasote, Claytone  and\n      Setyawan, Monang  and\n      Sarin, Supheakmungkol  and\n      Samb, Sokhar  and\n      Sagot, Beno{\\^\\i}t  and\n      Rivera, Clara  and\n      Rios, Annette  and\n      Papadimitriou, Isabel  and\n      Osei, Salomey  and\n      Suarez, Pedro Ortiz  and\n      Orife, Iroro  and\n      Ogueji, Kelechi  and\n      Rubungo, Andre Niyongabo  and\n      Nguyen, Toan Q.  and\n      M{\\\"u}ller, Mathias  and\n      M{\\\"u}ller, Andr{\\'e}  and\n      Muhammad, Shamsuddeen Hassan  and\n      Muhammad, Nanda  and\n      Mnyakeni, Ayanda  and\n      Mirzakhalov, Jamshidbek  and\n      Matangira, Tapiwanashe  and\n      Leong, Colin  and\n      Lawson, Nze  and\n      Kudugunta, Sneha  and\n      Jernite, Yacine  and\n      Jenny, Mathias  and\n      Firat, Orhan  and\n      Dossou, Bonaventure F.

In addition, many are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language codes.

We show that, despite the noise in the Common-Crawl-based OSCAR data, embeddings trained on OSCAR perform much better than monolingual embeddings trained on Wikipedia. They actually equal or improve the current state of the art in tagging and parsing for all five languages. In particular, they also improve over multilingual Wikipedia-based contextual embeddings (multilingual BERT), which almost always constitutes the previous state of the art, thereby showing that the benefit of a larger, more diverse corpus surpasses the cross-lingual benefit of multilingual embedding architectures.\",\n}\n@inproceedings{OrtizSuarezSagotRomary2019,\n  author    = {Pedro Javier {Ortiz Su{\\'a}rez} and Benoit Sagot and Laurent Romary},\n  title     = {Asynchronous pipelines for processing huge corpora on medium to low resource infrastructures},\n  series = {Proceedings of the Workshop on Challenges in the Management of Large Corpora (CMLC-7) 2019.

We propose a general, highly parallel, multithreaded pipeline to clean and classify Common Crawl by language; we specifically design it so that it runs efficiently on medium to low resource infrastructures where I/O speeds are the main constraint. We develop the pipeline so that it can be easily reapplied to any kind of heterogeneous corpus and so that it can be parameterised to a wide range of infrastructures.
