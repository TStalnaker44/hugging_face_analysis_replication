Second, most metadata might be \n                irrelevant for most use cases. \n                In our minds the most interesting metadata is the celex-id which is used to identify the legal \n                document at hand, but also contains a lot of information about the document \n                see [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/content/tools/eur-lex-celex-infographic-A3.pdf] as well as eurovoc-\n                concepts, which are labels that define the content of the documents. \n                Eurovoc-Concepts are, for example, only available for the sectors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, C, and E.\n                The Naming of most metadata is kept like it was on the eurlex website, except for converting \n                it to lower case and replacing whitespaces with '_'.", "downloads": 223, "tags": ["task_categories:text-classification", "task_categories:fill-mask", "task_ids:multi-class-classification", "task_ids:multi-label-classification", "annotations_creators:found", "language_creators:found", "multilinguality:multilingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:bg", "language:cs", "language:da", "language:de", "language:el", "language:en", "language:es", "language:et", "language:fi", "language:fr", "language:ga", "language:hr", "language:hu", "language:it", "language:lt", "language:lv", "language:mt", "language:nl", "language:pl", "language:pt", "language:ro", "language:sk", "language:sl", "language:sv", "license:mit", "size_categories:1M<n<10M", "region:us", "legal documents", "corpus", "eurlex", "html"], "createdAt": "2023-02-23T08:14:37.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "642554139c641fcd460ddb97", "id": "Francesco/road-signs-6ih4y", "author": "Francesco", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-03-30T09:19:50.000Z", "likes": 6, "private": false, "sha": "93e8ccea7a18f0d0173be9d04da24fea9f607ead", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for road-signs-6ih4y\n\t\n\n** The original COCO dataset is stored at dataset.tar.gz**\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Summary\n\t\n\nroad-signs-6ih4y\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSupported Tasks and Leaderboards\n\t\n\n\nobject-detection: The dataset can be used to train a model for Object Detection.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLanguages\n\t\n\nEnglish\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Structure\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tData Instances\n\t\n\nA data point comprises an image and its object annotations.\n{\n  'image_id': 15,\n  'image':\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Francesco/road-signs-6ih4y.", "downloads": 223, "tags": ["task_categories:object-detection", "annotations_creators:crowdsourced", "language_creators:found", "multilinguality:monolingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:en", "license:cc", "size_categories:1K<n<10K", "format:parquet", "modality:image", "library:datasets", "library:pandas", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "rf100", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-03-30T09:19:15.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "644126c14c2acf33989f7622", "id": "Babelscape/multinerd", "author": "Babelscape", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-04-20T12:43:31.000Z", "likes": 16, "private": false, "sha": "2814b78e7af4b5a1f1886fe7ad49632de4d9dd25", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for MultiNERD dataset\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDescription\n\t\n\n\nSummary: In a nutshell, MultiNERD is the first language-agnostic methodology for automatically creating multilingual, multi-genre and fine-grained annotations for Named Entity Recognition and Entity Disambiguation.

It was then improved with the purpose of creating a gold standard set of normalized entities for French biomedical text, that was used in the CLEF eHealth evaluation lab [2][3].\nA selection of MEDLINE titles and EMEA documents were manually annotated. The annotation process was guided by concepts in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS):\n1. Ten types of clinical entities, as defined by the following UMLS Semantic Groups (Bodenreider and McCray 2003) were annotated: Anatomy, Chemical and Drugs, Devices, Disorders, Geographic Areas, Living Beings, Objects, Phenomena, Physiology, Procedures.\n2. The annotations were made in a comprehensive fashion, so that nested entities were marked, and entities could be mapped to more than one UMLS concept. In particular: (a) If a mention can refer to more than one Semantic Group, all the relevant Semantic Groups should be annotated. For instance, the mention \u201cr\u00e9cidive\u201d (recurrence) in the phrase \u201cpr\u00e9vention des r\u00e9cidives\u201d (recurrence prevention) should be annotated with the category \u201cDISORDER\u201d (CUI C2825055) and the category \u201cPHENOMENON\u201d (CUI C0034897); (b) If a mention can refer to more than one UMLS concept within the same Semantic Group, all the relevant concepts should be annotated. For instance, the mention \u201cmaniaques\u201d (obsessive) in the phrase \u201cpatients maniaques\u201d (obsessive patients) should be annotated with CUIs C0564408 and C0338831 (category \u201cDISORDER\u201d); (c) Entities which span overlaps with that of another entity should still be annotated. For instance, in the phrase \u201cinfarctus du myocarde\u201d (myocardial infarction), the mention \u201cmyocarde\u201d (myocardium) should be annotated with category \u201cANATOMY\u201d (CUI C0027061) and the mention \u201cinfarctus du myocarde\u201d should be annotated with category \u201cDISORDER\u201d (CUI C0027051)\nThe QUAERO French Medical Corpus BioC release comprises a subset of the QUAERO French Medical corpus, as follows:\nTraining data (BRAT version used in CLEF eHealth 2015 task 1b as training data): \n- MEDLINE_train_bioc file: 833 MEDLINE titles, annotated with normalized entities in the BioC format \n- EMEA_train_bioc file: 3 EMEA documents, segmented into 11 sub-documents, annotated with normalized entities in the BioC format \nDevelopment data  (BRAT version used in CLEF eHealth 2015 task 1b as test data and in CLEF eHealth 2016 task 2 as development data): \n- MEDLINE_dev_bioc file: 832 MEDLINE titles, annotated with normalized entities in the BioC format\n- EMEA_dev_bioc file: 3 EMEA documents, segmented into 12 sub-documents, annotated with normalized entities in the BioC format \nTest data (BRAT version used in CLEF eHealth 2016 task 2 as test data): \n- MEDLINE_test_bioc folder: 833 MEDLINE titles, annotated with normalized entities in the BioC format \n- EMEA folder_test_bioc: 4 EMEA documents, segmented into 15 sub-documents, annotated with normalized entities in the BioC format \nThis release of the QUAERO French medical corpus, BioC version, comes in the BioC format, through automatic conversion from the original BRAT format obtained with the Brat2BioC tool https://bitbucket.org/nicta_biomed/brat2bioc developped by Jimeno Yepes et al.\nAntonio Jimeno Yepes, Mariana Neves, Karin Verspoor \nBrat2BioC: conversion tool between brat and BioC\nBioCreative IV track 1 - BioC: The BioCreative Interoperability Initiative, 2013\nPlease note that the original version of the QUAERO corpus distributed in the CLEF eHealth challenge 2015 and 2016 came in the BRAT stand alone format.

Data-to-text annotations can be a costly process, especially when dealing with tables which are the major source of structured data and contain nontrivial structures. To this end, we propose a procedure of extracting semantic triples from tables that encodes their structures by exploiting the semantic dependencies among table headers and the table title. Our dataset construction framework effectively merged heterogeneous sources from open domain semantic parsing and spoken dialogue systems by utilizing techniques including tree ontology annotation, question-answer pair to declarative sentence conversion, and predicate unification, all with minimum post-editing. We present systematic evaluation on DART as well as new state-of-the-art results on WebNLG 2017 to show that DART (1) poses new challenges to existing data-to-text datasets and (2) facilitates out-of-domain generalization.

Previous research has focused on developing labeled and unlabeled corpora for these languages through online scraping and document translation. While these methods have proven effective and cost-efficient, we have identified limitations in the resulting corpora, including a lack of lexical diversity and cultural relevance to local communities. To address this gap, we conduct a case study on Indonesian local languages. We compare the effectiveness of online scraping, human translation, and paragraph writing by native speakers in constructing datasets. Our findings demonstrate that datasets generated through paragraph writing by native speakers exhibit superior quality in terms of lexical diversity and cultural content. In addition, we present the NusaWrites benchmark, encompassing 12 underrepresented and extremely low-resource languages spoken by millions of individuals in Indonesia. Our empirical experiment results using existing multilingual large language models conclude the need to extend these models to more underrepresented languages.\n    We introduce a novel high quality human curated corpora, i.e., NusaMenulis, which covers 12 languages spoken in Indonesia. The resource extend the coverage of languages to 5 new languages, i.e., Ambon (abs), Bima (bhp), Makassarese (mak), Palembang / Musi (mui), and Rejang (rej).\n    For the rhetoric mode classification task, we cover 5 rhetoric modes, i.e., narrative, persuasive, argumentative, descriptive, and expository.", "downloads": 213, "tags": ["license:apache-2.0", "region:us"], "createdAt": "2023-09-07T12:58:44.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "664f61a1d5bea69bcad67fac", "id": "i4ds/radio-sunburst-ecallisto-paths-df-v2", "author": "i4ds", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-05-30T21:32:18.000Z", "likes": 0, "private": false, "sha": "e60a5f8915c74aa11ef8c179c7776c2946f10f2a", "downloads": 213, "tags": ["size_categories:100K<n<1M", "format:parquet", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:pandas", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2024-05-23T15:32:49.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "6667ad450209de0f573a8217", "id": "GitBag/amazon_movie_tv_item_mxbai_v5", "author": "GitBag", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-06-11T01:49:59.000Z", "likes": 0, "private": false, "sha": "9309c913eb9dc55aa9ca90d3c48fdb2f838e186e", "downloads": 213, "tags": ["size_categories:10K<n<100K", "format:parquet", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:pandas", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2024-06-11T01:49:57.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "666f467465901a559ffb8e52", "id": "danielcd99/imdb", "author": "danielcd99", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-06-16T20:10:05.000Z", "likes": 0, "private": false, "sha": "7e682ca8d687910d3dfd94ff0452a03e0aecc421", "downloads": 213, "tags": ["size_categories:10K<n<100K", "format:csv", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:pandas", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2024-06-16T20:09:24.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "667095ca459aa2d3b9459607", "id": "open-llm-leaderboard/CohereForAI__c4ai-command-r-v01-details", "author": "open-llm-leaderboard", "disabled": false, "gated": "auto", "lastModified": "2024-06-17T20:04:01.000Z", "likes": 0, "private": false, "sha": "cfa436389c09fbd6163c25d0ea82d3abac4ca3a3", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for Evaluation run of CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01\n\t\n\n\n\nDataset automatically created during the evaluation run of model CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01\nThe dataset is composed of 44 configuration(s), each one corresponding to one of the evaluated task.\nThe dataset has been created from 1 run(s).

Product Reviews) is one of Amazons iconic products. In a period of over two decades since the first review in 1995, millions of Amazon customers have contributed over a hundred million reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website. This makes Amazon Customer Reviews a rich source of information for academic researchers in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Machine Learning (ML), amongst others. Accordingly, we are releasing this data to further research in multiple disciplines related to understanding customer product experiences. Specifically, this dataset was constructed to represent a sample of customer evaluations and opinions, variation in the perception of a product across geographical regions, and promotional intent or bias in reviews.\n\nOver 130+ million customer reviews are available to researchers as part of this release. The data is available in TSV files in the amazon-reviews-pds S3 bucket in AWS US East Region.

The two corresponding synthetic images differ only in terms of the altered subject in the two captions. In our accompanying paper, we showed that the COCO-Counterfactuals dataset is challenging for existing pre-trained multimodal models and significantly increase the difficulty of the zero-shot image-text retrieval and image-text matching tasks.

All reviews are truncated after 2,000 characters, and all reviews are at least 20 characters long.\n\nNote that the language of a review does not necessarily match the language of its marketplace (e.g. reviews from amazon.de are primarily written in German, but could also be written in English, etc.). For this reason, we applied a language detection algorithm based on the work in Bojanowski et al. (2017) to determine the language of the review text and we removed reviews that were not written in the expected language.", "downloads": 189, "tags": ["task_categories:summarization", "task_categories:text-generation", "task_categories:fill-mask", "task_categories:text-classification", "task_ids:text-scoring", "task_ids:language-modeling", "task_ids:masked-language-modeling", "task_ids:sentiment-classification", "task_ids:sentiment-scoring", "task_ids:topic-classification", "annotations_creators:found", "language_creators:found", "multilinguality:monolingual", "multilinguality:multilingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:de", "language:en", "language:es", "language:fr", "language:ja", "language:zh", "license:other", "size_categories:100K<n<1M", "arxiv:2010.02573", "region:us"], "createdAt": "2022-03-02T23:29:22.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "621ffdd236468d709f181dd7", "id": "ZihanWangKi/conllpp", "author": "ZihanWangKi", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-01-18T09:35:35.000Z", "likes": 14, "private": false, "sha": "f9205bbe2a0ac3ec159599e7a1e1694f4080a39b", "citation": "@inproceedings{wang2019crossweigh,\n  title={CrossWeigh: Training Named Entity Tagger from Imperfect Annotations},\n  author={Wang, Zihan and Shang, Jingbo and Liu, Liyuan and Lu, Lihao and Liu, Jiacheng and Han, Jiawei},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP)},\n  pages={5157--5166},\n  year={2019}\n}", "description": "CoNLLpp is a corrected version of the CoNLL2003 NER dataset where labels of 5.38% of the sentences in the test set\nhave been manually corrected.

Previous research has focused on developing labeled and unlabeled corpora for these languages through online scraping and document translation. While these methods have proven effective and cost-efficient, we have identified limitations in the resulting corpora, including a lack of lexical diversity and cultural relevance to local communities. To address this gap, we conduct a case study on Indonesian local languages. We compare the effectiveness of online scraping, human translation, and paragraph writing by native speakers in constructing datasets. Our findings demonstrate that datasets generated through paragraph writing by native speakers exhibit superior quality in terms of lexical diversity and cultural content. In addition, we present the NusaWrites benchmark, encompassing 12 underrepresented and extremely low-resource languages spoken by millions of individuals in Indonesia. Our empirical experiment results using existing multilingual large language models conclude the need to extend these models to more underrepresented languages.\n    We introduce a novel high quality human curated corpora, i.e., NusaMenulis, which covers 12 languages spoken in Indonesia. The resource extend the coverage of languages to 5 new languages, i.e., Ambon (abs), Bima (bhp), Makassarese (mak), Palembang / Musi (mui), and Rejang (rej).\n    For the rhetoric mode classification task, we cover 5 rhetoric modes, i.e., narrative, persuasive, argumentative, descriptive, and expository.", "downloads": 189, "tags": ["language:abs", "language:btk", "language:bew", "language:bug", "language:jav", "language:mad", "language:mak", "language:min", "language:mui", "language:rej", "language:sun", "arxiv:2406.10118", "region:us", "emotion-classification"], "createdAt": "2023-09-26T11:16:49.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "651c77f5e6f329d951a4bdbe", "id": "Elriggs/openwebtext-100k", "author": "Elriggs", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-10-03T20:23:28.000Z", "likes": 6, "private": false, "sha": "2b7bfd980d5227806de62ac735f40712a4881273", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for \"openwebtext-100k\"\n\t\n\nMore Information needed\n", "downloads": 189, "tags": ["size_categories:100K<n<1M", "format:parquet", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:pandas", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-10-03T20:22:13.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "651cb02351c2045c4cbed6e8", "id": "open-llm-leaderboard-old/details_LeoLM__leo-hessianai-7b-chat-bilingual", "author": "open-llm-leaderboard-old", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-10-23T19:54:21.000Z", "likes": 0, "private": false, "sha": "1f7b477657d7b9db013ca28d748ab3fc4ce1b0ab", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for Evaluation run of LeoLM/leo-hessianai-7b-chat-bilingual\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Summary\n\t\n\nDataset automatically created during the evaluation run of model LeoLM/leo-hessianai-7b-chat-bilingual on the Open LLM Leaderboard.\nThe dataset is composed of 64 configuration, each one coresponding to one of the evaluated task.\nThe dataset has been created from 2 run(s).
