Since many tasks in BBH require multi-step reasoning, few-shot prompting without CoT, as done in the BIG-Bench evaluations (Srivastava et al., 2022), substantially underestimates the best performance and capabilities of language models, which is better captured via CoT prompting. As further analysis, we explore the interaction between CoT and model scale on BBH, finding that CoT enables emergent task performance on several BBH tasks with otherwise flat scaling curves.", "downloads": 911736, "tags": ["size_categories:1K<n<10K", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-02-01T07:46:51.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "64986d58dc503810829819bf", "id": "haonan-li/cmmlu", "author": "haonan-li", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-07-13T10:19:29.000Z", "likes": 48, "private": false, "sha": "efcc940752ea4a1ea94d2727f11f83858d64fc8e", "citation": "@misc{li2023cmmlu,\n      title={CMMLU: Measuring massive multitask language understanding in Chinese},\n      author={Haonan Li and Yixuan Zhang and Fajri Koto and Yifei Yang and Hai Zhao and Yeyun Gong and Nan Duan and Timothy Baldwin},\n      year={2023},\n      eprint={2306.09212},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL}\n}", "description": "CMMLU is a comprehensive Chinese assessment suite specifically designed to evaluate the advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs within the Chinese language and cultural context.", "downloads": 633608, "tags": ["task_categories:multiple-choice", "task_categories:question-answering", "language:zh", "license:cc-by-nc-4.0", "size_categories:10K<n<100K", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:mlcroissant", "arxiv:2306.09212", "region:us", "chinese", "llm", "evaluation", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-06-25T16:37:44.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "65e7ef531c266121caf45895", "id": "chansung/requested-arxiv-ids-3", "author": "chansung", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-05-15T21:10:31.000Z", "likes": 0, "private": false, "sha": "ba29ec15eaed5a54bd42670caa4086dd448ddbda", "downloads": 587249, "tags": ["size_categories:n<1K", "format:parquet", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:pandas", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2024-03-06T04:21:39.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "621ffdd236468d709f181e5e", "id": "cais/mmlu", "author": "cais", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-03-08T20:36:26.000Z", "likes": 271, "private": false, "sha": "c30699e8356da336a370243923dbaf21066bb9fe", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for MMLU\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Summary\n\t\n\nMeasuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding by Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt (ICLR 2021).\nThis is a massive multitask test consisting of multiple-choice questions from various branches of knowledge.

However, most of these large raw corpora are either available only for English or not available to the general public due to copyright issues. Nevertheless, there are some examples of freely available multilingual corpora for training Deep Learning NLP models, such as the OSCAR and Paracrawl corpora. However, they have quality issues, especially for low-resource languages. Moreover, recreating or updating these corpora is very complex. In this work, we try to reproduce and improve the goclassy pipeline used to create the OSCAR corpus. We propose a new pipeline that is faster, modular, parameterizable, and well documented. We use it to create a corpus similar to OSCAR but larger and based on recent data. Also, unlike OSCAR, the metadata information is at the document level.

In addition, many are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language codes.

They actually equal or improve the current state of the art in tagging and parsing for all five languages.

product reviews dataset for multilingual text classification. The dataset contains reviews in English, Japanese, German, French, Chinese and Spanish, collected between November 1, 2015 and November 1, 2019. Each record in the dataset contains the review text, the review title, the star rating, an anonymized reviewer ID, an anonymized product ID and the coarse-grained product category (e.g. \u2018books\u2019, \u2018appliances\u2019, etc.) The corpus is balanced across stars, so each star rating constitutes 20% of the reviews in each language.\nFor each language, there are 200,000, 5,000 and 5,000 reviews in the training, development and test sets respectively. The maximum number of reviews per reviewer is 20 and the maximum number of reviews per product is 20. All reviews are truncated after 2,000 characters, and all reviews are at least 20 characters long.\nNote that the language of a review does not necessarily match the language of its marketplace (e.g. reviews from amazon.de are primarily written in German, but could also be written in English, etc.). For this reason, we applied a language detection algorithm based on the work in Bojanowski et al. (2017) to determine the language of the review text and we removed reviews that were not written in the expected language.", "downloads": 27726, "tags": ["language:de", "language:en", "language:es",

Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveyed through text, a robust mechanism capable of capturing and modeling different linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. We propose a semi-supervised, graph-based algorithm to produce rich structural descriptors which serve as the building blocks for constructing contextualized affect representations from text. The pattern-based representations are further enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on emotion recognition tasks.\",\n}", "description": "Emotion is a dataset of English Twitter messages with six basic emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise.

The paradigm\npretrains a shared model on large volumes of unlabeled data and achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for various tasks with minimal adaptation. However, the\nspeech processing community lacks a similar setup to systematically explore the\nparadigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce Speech processing Universal\nPERformance Benchmark (SUPERB). SUPERB is a leaderboard to benchmark the\nperformance of a shared model across a wide range of speech processing tasks\nwith minimal architecture changes and labeled data. Among multiple usages of the\nshared model, we especially focus on extracting the representation learned from\nSSL due to its preferable re-usability. We present a simple framework to solve\nSUPERB tasks by learning task-specialized lightweight prediction heads on top of\nthe frozen shared model. Our results demonstrate that the framework is promising\nas SSL representations show competitive generalizability and accessibility\nacross SUPERB tasks.

The paradigm\npretrains a shared model on large volumes of unlabeled data and achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for various tasks with minimal adaptation. However, the\nspeech processing community lacks a similar setup to systematically explore the\nparadigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce Speech processing Universal\nPERformance Benchmark (SUPERB). SUPERB is a leaderboard to benchmark the\nperformance of a shared model across a wide range of speech processing tasks\nwith minimal architecture changes and labeled data. Among multiple usages of the\nshared model, we especially focus on extracting the representation learned from\nSSL due to its preferable re-usability. We present a simple framework to solve\nSUPERB tasks by learning task-specialized lightweight prediction heads on top of\nthe frozen shared model. Our results demonstrate that the framework is promising\nas SSL representations show competitive generalizability and accessibility\nacross SUPERB tasks. We release SUPERB as a challenge with a leaderboard and a\nbenchmark toolkit to fuel the research in representation learning and general\nspeech processing.\n\nNote that in order to limit the required storage for preparing this dataset, the\naudio is stored in the .flac format and is not converted to a float32 array.

Especially in the case of finance and economic texts, annotated\ncollections are a scarce resource and many are reserved for proprietary use\nonly. To resolve the missing training data problem, we present a collection of\n\u223c 5000 sentences to establish human-annotated standards for benchmarking\nalternative modeling techniques.\n\nThe objective of the phrase level annotation task was to classify each example\nsentence into a positive, negative or neutral category by considering only the\ninformation explicitly available in the given sentence. Since the study is\nfocused only on financial and economic domains, the annotators were asked to\nconsider the sentences from the view point of an investor only; i.e. whether\nthe news may have positive, negative or neutral influence on the stock price.\nAs a result, sentences which have a sentiment that is not relevant from an\neconomic or financial perspective are considered neutral.\n\nThis release of the financial phrase bank covers a collection of 4840\nsentences. The selected collection of phrases was annotated by 16 people with\nadequate background knowledge on financial markets. Three of the annotators\nwere researchers and the remaining 13 annotators were master\u2019s students at\nAalto University School of Business with majors primarily in finance,\naccounting, and economics.\n\nGiven the large number of overlapping annotations (5 to 8 annotations per\nsentence), there are several ways to define a majority vote based gold\nstandard. To provide an objective comparison, we have formed 4 alternative\nreference datasets based on the strength of majority agreement: all annotators\nagree, >=75% of annotators agree, >=66% of annotators agree and >=50% of\nannotators agree.", "downloads": 6539, "tags": ["task_categories:text-classification", "task_ids:multi-class-classification", "task_ids:sentiment-classification", "annotations_creators:expert-generated", "language_creators:found", "multilinguality:monolingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:en", "license:cc-by-nc-sa-3.0", "size_categories:1K<n<10K", "arxiv:1307.5336", "region:us", "finance"], "createdAt": "2022-03-02T23:29:22.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "659ebc85a8b284e4a05b9284", "id": "hails/agieval-lsat-rc", "author": "hails", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-01-26T18:45:21.000Z", "likes": 0, "private": false, "sha": "432868ea4fa7b50db66d14524d42472dd052b53c", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for \"agieval-lsat-rc\"\n\t\n\nDataset taken from https://github.com/microsoft/AGIEval and processed as in that repo, following dmayhem93/agieval-* datasets on the HF hub.\nThis dataset contains the contents of the LSAT reading comprehension subtask of AGIEval, as accessed in https://github.com/ruixiangcui/AGIEval/commit/5c77d073fda993f1652eaae3cf5d04cc5fd21d40 .\nCitation:\n@misc{zhong2023agieval,\n      title={AGIEval: A Human-Centric Benchmark for Evaluating Foundation\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/hails/agieval-lsat-rc.", "downloads": 6502, "tags": ["size_categories:n<1K", "format:parquet", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:pandas", "library:mlcroissant", "arxiv:2304.06364", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2024-01-10T15:49:25.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "662ed6d75cbdc931c5231de9", "id": "RLHFlow/prm80k-phase2", "author": "RLHFlow", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-04-28T23:09:51.000Z", "likes": 1, "private": false, "sha": "0fa663fa9e1703ee241d63a9b6b1c93aa4e7c4a0", "downloads": 6499, "tags": ["size_categories:10K<n<100K", "format:parquet", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:pandas", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2024-04-28T23:08:07.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "6535918c9860c1cb37f4d140", "id": "georgeyw/dsir-pile-1m", "author": "georgeyw", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-10-22T21:20:58.000Z", "likes": 0, "private": false, "sha": "00d20bb0af2a497755fff69590a4ef3bcb08e3f6", "downloads": 6464, "tags": ["license:mit", "size_categories:1M<n<10M", "format:json", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:pandas", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-10-22T21:18:04.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "63990f21cc50af73d29ecfa3", "id": "fka/awesome-chatgpt-prompts", "author": "fka", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-03-07T10:04:18.000Z", "likes": 5011, "private": false, "sha": "7baf3f8a5f3d38acc585d42d12193b27baf8cf79", "description": "\ud83e\udde0 Awesome ChatGPT Prompts [CSV dataset]\n\nThis is a Dataset Repository of Awesome ChatGPT Prompts\nView All Prompts on GitHub\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLicense\n\t\n\nCC-0\n", "downloads": 6459, "tags": ["license:cc0-1.0", "size_categories:n<1K", "format:csv", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:pandas", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "ChatGPT", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2022-12-13T23:47:45.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "6539bda9e279d2fc80bfc994", "id": "togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-V2", "author": "togethercomputer", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-01-18T15:32:36.000Z", "likes": 325, "private": false, "sha": "e04bdecaa958f3429e7e7d26f1e77831602e5da5", "description": "RedPajama V2: an Open Dataset for Training Large Language Models", "downloads": 6446, "tags": ["task_categories:text-generation", "language:en", "language:de", "language:fr", "language:es", "language:it", "size_categories:1M<n<10M", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:mlcroissant", "arxiv:2302.03169", "arxiv:2302.13971", "arxiv:2204.02311", "arxiv:2112.06905", "arxiv:1910.10683", "arxiv:2305.13169", "arxiv:2306.01116", "arxiv:2112.11446", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-10-26T01:15:21.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "621ffdd236468d709f183be7", "id": "nielsr/funsd", "author": "nielsr", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2021-07-27T07:59:20.000Z", "likes": 11, "private": false, "sha": "cc411ada8b05f1f67d5348b3baeba45aa3218c1a", "citation": "@article{Jaume2019FUNSDAD,\n  title={FUNSD: A Dataset for Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents},\n  author={Guillaume Jaume and H.

We show that, despite the noise in the Common-Crawl-based OSCAR data, embeddings trained on OSCAR perform much better than monolingual embeddings trained on Wikipedia. They actually equal or improve the current state of the art in tagging and parsing for all five languages. In particular, they also improve over multilingual Wikipedia-based contextual embeddings (multilingual BERT), which almost always constitutes the previous state of the art, thereby showing that the benefit of a larger, more diverse corpus surpasses the cross-lingual benefit of multilingual embedding architectures.\",\n}\n\n@inproceedings{OrtizSuarezSagotRomary2019,\n  author    = {Pedro Javier {Ortiz Su{\\'a}rez} and Benoit Sagot and Laurent Romary},\n  title     = {Asynchronous pipelines for processing huge corpora on medium to low resource infrastructures},\n  series = {Proceedings of the Workshop on Challenges in the Management of Large Corpora (CMLC-7) 2019.

Even though each document has a metadata block associated to it, this data lacks any information about the language in which each document is written, making it extremely difficult to use Common Crawl for monolingual applications. We propose a general, highly parallel, multithreaded pipeline to clean and classify Common Crawl by language; we specifically design it so that it runs efficiently on medium to low resource infrastructures where I/O speeds are the main constraint. We develop the pipeline so that it can be easily reapplied to any kind of heterogeneous corpus and so that it can be parameterised to a wide range of infrastructures. We also distribute a 6.3TB version of Common Crawl, filtered, classified by language, shuffled at line level in order to avoid copyright issues, and ready to be used for NLP applications.},\n  language  = {en}\n}", "description": "The Open Super-large Crawled ALMAnaCH coRpus is a huge multilingual corpus obtained by language classification and filtering of the Common Crawl corpus using the goclassy architecture.\\", "downloads": 3352, "paperswithcode_id": "oscar", "tags": ["task_categories:text-generation", "task_categories:fill-mask", "task_ids:language-modeling", "task_ids:masked-language-modeling", "annotations_creators:no-annotation", "language_creators:found", "multilinguality:multilingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:af", "language:als", "language:am", "language:an", "language:ar", "language:arz", "language:as", "language:ast", "language:av", "language:az", "language:azb", "language:ba", "language:bar", "language:bcl", "language:be", "language:bg", "language:bh", "language:bn", "language:bo", "language:bpy", "language:br", "language:bs", "language:bxr", "language:ca", "language:cbk", "language:ce", "language:ceb", "language:ckb", "language:cs", "language:cv", "language:cy", "language:da", "language:de", "language:diq", "language:dsb", "language:dv", "language:el", "language:eml", "language:en", "language:eo", "language:es", "language:et", "language:eu", "language:fa", "language:fi", "language:fr", "language:frr", "language:fy", "language:ga", "language:gd", "language:gl", "language:gn", "language:gom", "language:gu", "language:he", "language:hi", "language:hr", "language:hsb", "language:ht", "language:hu", "language:hy", "language:ia", "language:id", "language:ie", "language:ilo", "language:io", "language:is", "language:it", "language:ja", "language:jbo", "language:jv", "language:ka", "language:kk", "language:km", "language:kn", "language:ko", "language:krc", "language:ku", "language:kv", "language:kw", "language:ky", "language:la", "language:lb", "language:lez", "language:li", "language:lmo", "language:lo", "language:lrc", "language:lt", "language:lv", "language:mai", "language:mg", "language:mhr", "language:min", "language:mk", "language:ml", "language:mn", "language:mr", "language:mrj", "language:ms", "language:mt", "language:mwl", "language:my", "language:myv", "language:mzn", "language:nah", "language:nap", "language:nds", "language:ne", "language:new", "language:nl", "language:nn", "language:no", "language:oc", "language:or", "language:os", "language:pa", "language:pam", "language:pl", "language:pms", "language:pnb", "language:ps", "language:pt", "language:qu", "language:rm", "language:ro", "language:ru", "language:sa", "language:sah", "language:scn", "language:sd", "language:sh", "language:si", "language:sk", "language:sl", "language:so", "language:sq", "language:sr", "language:su", "language:sv", "language:sw", "language:ta", "language:te", "language:tg", "language:th", "language:tk", "language:tl", "language:tr", "language:tt", "language:tyv", "language:ug", "language:uk", "language:ur", "language:uz", "language:vec", "language:vi", "language:vo", "language:wa", "language:war", "language:wuu", "language:xal", "language:xmf", "language:yi", "language:yo", "language:yue", "language:zh", "license:cc0-1.0", "size_categories:100K<n<1M", "arxiv:2010.14571", "region:us"], "createdAt": "2022-03-02T23:29:22.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "66207aae4e76ab3a7a98eee8", "id": "hendrydong/preference_700K", "author": "hendrydong", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-04-18T01:43:54.000Z", "likes": 1, "private": false, "sha": "008cf51c01c025a303b6f27a005c2b7e31e28615", "downloads": 3349, "tags": ["size_categories:100K<n<1M", "format:parquet", "modality:tabular", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:dask", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2024-04-18T01:43:10.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "6484fbc6094b52d75563df19", "id": "graelo/wikipedia", "author": "graelo", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-09-10T06:10:08.000Z", "likes": 58, "private": false, "sha": "3c5d9004085ff5de9d57f4224f4ab3d5d34af789", "citation": "@ONLINE {wikidump,\n    author = {Wikimedia Foundation},\n    title  = {Wikimedia Downloads},\n    url    = {https://dumps.wikimedia.org}\n}", "description": "Wikipedia dataset containing cleaned articles of all languages.\nThe datasets are built from the Wikipedia dump\n(https://dumps.wikimedia.org/) with one split per language.

Existing datasets for keyphrase generation are only readily available for the scholarly domain and include non-expert annotations. In this paper we present KPTimes, a large-scale dataset of news texts paired with editor-curated keyphrases.

This dataset was collected via the WinoGAViL online game to collect vision-and-language associations, (e.g., werewolves to a full moon). Inspired by the popular card game Codenames, a spymaster gives a textual cue related to several visual candidates, and another player has to identify them. Human players are rewarded for creating associations that are challenging for a rival AI model but still solvable by other human players. We evaluate several state-of-the-art vision-and-language models, finding that they are intuitive for humans (>90% Jaccard index) but challenging for state-of-the-art AI models, where the best model (ViLT) achieves a score of 52%, succeeding mostly where the cue is visually salient.

In particular, there is a lack of runnable, real-world datasets required for a range of tasks ranging from neural program synthesis to machine learning-guided program optimization. We introduce a new dataset, ExeBench, which attempts to address this. It tackles two key issues with real-world code: references to external types and functions and scalable generation of IO examples. ExeBench is the first publicly available dataset that pairs real-world C code taken from GitHub with IO examples that allow these programs to be run. We develop a toolchain that scrapes GitHub, analyzes the code, and generates runnable snippets of code. We analyze our benchmark suite using several metrics, and show it is representative of real-world code. ExeBench contains 4.5M compilable and 700k executable C functions. This scale of executable, real functions will enable the next generation of machine learning-based programming tasks.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Machine Programming},\npages = {50\u201359},\nnumpages = {10},\nkeywords = {Code Dataset, Program Synthesis, Mining Software Repositories, C, Machine Learning for Code, Compilers},\nlocation = {San Diego, CA, USA},\nseries = {MAPS 2022}\n}", "description": "An ML-scale dataset of executable C functions", "downloads": 1612, "tags": ["region:us"], "createdAt": "2022-07-30T20:07:06.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "64ae54c2afb6aa55343bc420", "id": "pufanyi/MIMICIT", "author": "pufanyi", "disabled": false, "gated": "auto", "lastModified": "2024-03-28T03:35:16.000Z", "likes": 37, "private": false, "sha": "7bed19ffea23748eff599fac87695b0e54c3094b", "description": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Bo Li*,\u2660,1\u2003\n    Yuanhan Zhang*,\u2660,1\u2003\n    Liangyu Chen*,1\u2003\n    Jinghao Wang*,1\u2003\n    Fanyi Pu*,1\u2003\n    \n    Jingkang Yang1\u2003\n    Chunyuan Li2\u2003\n    Ziwei Liu\u2709,1\n\n\n\n    1S-Lab, Nanyang Technological University\u2003\n    2Microsoft Research, Redmond\n    \n    \u2660 Co-Project Lead\u2003\n    * Equal Contribution\u2003\n    \u2709 Corresponding Author\n    \n\n\nNote 1: To reduce memory consumption during image loading and improve loading speed, we are converting the JSON format of images to the Parquet format.

However, most of these large raw corpora are either available only for English or not available to the general public due to copyright issues. Nevertheless, there are some examples of freely available multilingual corpora for training Deep Learning NLP models, such as the OSCAR and Paracrawl corpora. However, they have quality issues, especially for low-resource languages. Moreover, recreating or updating these corpora is very complex. In this work, we try to reproduce and improve the goclassy pipeline used to create the OSCAR corpus. We propose a new pipeline that is faster, modular, parameterizable, and well documented. We use it to create a corpus similar to OSCAR but larger and based on recent data. Also, unlike OSCAR, the metadata information is at the document level. We release our pipeline under an open source license and publish the corpus under a research-only license.},\n  language  = {en}\n}\n\n@article{caswell-etal-2021-quality,\n       author = {{Caswell}, Isaac and {Kreutzer}, Julia and {Wang}, Lisa and {Wahab}, Ahsan and {van Esch}, Daan and {Ulzii-Orshikh}, Nasanbayar and {Tapo}, Allahsera and {Subramani}, Nishant and {Sokolov}, Artem and {Sikasote}, Claytone and {Setyawan}, Monang and {Sarin}, Supheakmungkol and {Samb}, Sokhar and {Sagot}, Beno{\\^\\i}t and {Rivera}, Clara and {Rios}, Annette and {Papadimitriou}, Isabel and {Osei}, Salomey and {Ortiz Su{\\'a}rez}, Pedro Javier and {Orife}, Iroro and {Ogueji}, Kelechi and {Niyongabo}, Rubungo Andre and {Nguyen}, Toan Q. and {M{\\\"u}ller}, Mathias and {M{\\\"u}ller}, Andr{\\'e} and {Hassan Muhammad}, Shamsuddeen and {Muhammad}, Nanda and {Mnyakeni}, Ayanda and {Mirzakhalov}, Jamshidbek and {Matangira}, Tapiwanashe and {Leong}, Colin and {Lawson}, Nze and {Kudugunta}, Sneha and {Jernite}, Yacine and {Jenny}, Mathias and {Firat}, Orhan and {Dossou}, Bonaventure F.~P. and {Dlamini}, Sakhile and {de Silva}, Nisansa and {{\\c{C}}abuk Ball{\\i}}, Sakine and {Biderman}, Stella and {Battisti}, Alessia and {Baruwa}, Ahmed and {Bapna}, Ankur and {Baljekar}, Pallavi and {Abebe Azime}, Israel and {Awokoya}, Ayodele and {Ataman}, Duygu and {Ahia}, Orevaoghene and {Ahia}, Oghenefego and {Agrawal}, Sweta and {Adeyemi}, Mofetoluwa},\n        title = \"{Quality at a Glance: An Audit of Web-Crawled Multilingual Datasets}\",\n      journal = {arXiv e-prints},\n     keywords = {Computer Science - Computation and Language, Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence},\n         year = 2021,\n        month = mar,\n          eid = {arXiv:2103.12028},\n        pages = {arXiv:2103.12028},\narchivePrefix = {arXiv},\n       eprint = {2103.12028},\n primaryClass = {cs.CL},\n       adsurl = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210312028C},\n      adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{ortiz-suarez-etal-2020-monolingual,\n    title = \"A Monolingual Approach to Contextualized Word Embeddings for Mid-Resource Languages\",\n    author = \"Ortiz Su{\\'a}rez, Pedro Javier  and\n      Romary, Laurent  and\n      Sagot, Benoit\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n    month = jul,\n    year = \"2020\",\n    address = \"Online\",\n    publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n    url = \"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.156\",\n    pages = \"1703--1714\",\n    abstract = \"We use the multilingual OSCAR corpus, extracted from Common Crawl via language classification, filtering and cleaning, to train monolingual contextualized word embeddings (ELMo) for five mid-resource languages.

We show that, despite the noise in the Common-Crawl-based OSCAR data, embeddings trained on OSCAR perform much better than monolingual embeddings trained on Wikipedia. They actually equal or improve the current state of the art in tagging and parsing for all five languages. In particular, they also improve over multilingual Wikipedia-based contextual embeddings (multilingual BERT), which almost always constitutes the previous state of the art, thereby showing that the benefit of a larger, more diverse corpus surpasses the cross-lingual benefit of multilingual embedding architectures.\",\n}\n\n@inproceedings{OrtizSuarezSagotRomary2019,\n  author    = {Pedro Javier {Ortiz Su{\\'a}rez} and Benoit Sagot and Laurent Romary},\n  title     = {Asynchronous pipelines for processing huge corpora on medium to low resource infrastructures},\n  series = {Proceedings of the Workshop on Challenges in the Management of Large Corpora (CMLC-7) 2019.

We develop the pipeline so that it can be easily reapplied to any kind of heterogeneous corpus and so that it can be parameterised to a wide range of infrastructures.

also contains metadata of book titles and publication dates.\n\nPG-19 is over double the size of the Billion Word benchmark and contains documents that are 20X longer, on average, than the WikiText long-range language modelling benchmark.\nBooks are partitioned into a train, validation, and test set. Book metadata is stored in metadata.csv which contains (book_id, short_book_title, publication_date).\n\nUnlike prior benchmarks, we do not constrain the vocabulary size --- i.e. mapping rare words to an UNK token --- but instead release the data as an open-vocabulary benchmark. The only processing of the text that has been applied is the removal of boilerplate license text, and the mapping of offensive discriminatory words as specified by Ofcom to placeholder tokens. Users are free to model the data at the character-level, subword-level, or via any mechanism that can model an arbitrary string of text.\nTo compare models we propose to continue measuring the word-level perplexity, by calculating the total likelihood of the dataset (via any chosen subword vocabulary or character-based scheme) divided by the number of tokens --- specified below in the dataset statistics table.\nOne could use this dataset for benchmarking long-range language models, or use it to pre-train for other natural language processing tasks which require long-range reasoning, such as LAMBADA or NarrativeQA. We would not recommend using this dataset to train a general-purpose language model, e.g. for applications to a production-system dialogue agent, due to the dated linguistic style of old texts and the inherent biases present in historical writing.", "downloads": 1507, "paperswithcode_id": "pg-19", "tags": ["task_categories:text-generation", "task_ids:language-modeling",

Second, we propose RED\\textsuperscript{FM}, a smaller, human-revised dataset for seven languages that allows for the evaluation of multilingual RE systems. \nTo demonstrate the utility of these novel datasets, we experiment with the first end-to-end multilingual RE model, mREBEL, \nthat extracts triplets, including entity types, in multiple languages.
