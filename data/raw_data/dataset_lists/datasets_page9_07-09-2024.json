It is a high-quality large-scale corpus that can be used to train summarization models for Catalan and Spanish.We have carried out an analysis of the corpus, both in terms of the style of the summaries and the difficulty of the summarization task. In particular, we have used a set of well-known metrics in the summarization field in order to characterize the corpus. Additionally, for benchmarking purposes, we have evaluated the performances of some extractive and abstractive summarization systems on the DACSA corpus.\",\n}", "description": "The Dataset for Automatic summarization of Catalan and Spanish newspaper\nArticles (DACSA) corpus.

Previous research has focused on developing labeled and unlabeled corpora for these languages through online scraping and document translation. While these methods have proven effective and cost-efficient, we have identified limitations in the resulting corpora, including a lack of lexical diversity and cultural relevance to local communities. To address this gap, we conduct a case study on Indonesian local languages. We compare the effectiveness of online scraping, human translation, and paragraph writing by native speakers in constructing datasets. Our findings demonstrate that datasets generated through paragraph writing by native speakers exhibit superior quality in terms of lexical diversity and cultural content. In addition, we present the NusaWrites benchmark, encompassing 12 underrepresented and extremely low-resource languages spoken by millions of individuals in Indonesia. Our empirical experiment results using existing multilingual large language models conclude the need to extend these models to more underrepresented languages.\n    We introduce a novel high quality human curated corpora, i.e., NusaMenulis, which covers 12 languages spoken in Indonesia. The resource extend the coverage of languages to 5 new languages, i.e., Ambon (abs), Bima (bhp), Makassarese (mak), Palembang / Musi (mui), and Rejang (rej).\n    For the rhetoric mode classification task, we cover 5 rhetoric modes, i.e., narrative, persuasive, argumentative, descriptive, and expository.", "downloads": 80, "tags": ["license:apache-2.0", "region:us"], "createdAt": "2023-09-07T12:57:23.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "64fb14278d50404bc4f77c68", "id": "EkBass/fin-eng-dataset", "author": "EkBass", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-10-29T08:32:14.000Z", "likes": 1, "private": false, "sha": "e80248af8879ee8f07ea9d83b805242e4d5c81c6", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tfin-eng-dataset\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tUpdated 29th October 2023\n\t\n\nNew version.

When\n    developing supervised named entity recognition (NER) systems, the\n    availability of a large, manually annotated text corpus is desirable.\n    Furthermore, large corpora permit the robust evaluation and comparison of\n    different approaches that detect chemicals in documents. We present the\n    CHEMDNER corpus, a collection of 10,000 PubMed abstracts that contain a\n    total of 84,355 chemical entity mentions labeled manually by expert\n    chemistry literature curators, following annotation guidelines specifically\n    defined for this task. The abstracts of the CHEMDNER corpus were selected\n    to be representative for all major chemical disciplines. Each of the\n    chemical entity mentions was manually labeled according to its\n    structure-associated chemical entity mention (SACEM) class: abbreviation,\n    family, formula, identifier, multiple, systematic and trivial. The\n    difficulty and consistency of tagging chemicals in text was measured using\n    an agreement study between annotators, obtaining a percentage agreement of\n    91. For a subset of the CHEMDNER corpus (the test set of 3,000 abstracts)\n    we provide not only the Gold Standard manual annotations, but also mentions\n    automatically detected by the 26 teams that participated in the BioCreative\n    IV CHEMDNER chemical mention recognition task. In addition, we release the\n    CHEMDNER silver standard corpus of automatically extracted mentions from\n    17,000 randomly selected PubMed abstracts. A version of the CHEMDNER corpus\n    in the BioC format has been generated as well.

This dataset was originally col- lected for the DARPA-TIDES surprise-language con- test in 2002, later refined at IIIT Hyderabad and provided for the NLP Tools Contest at ICON 2008 (Venkatapathy, 2008).\n\nCommentaries by Daniel Pipes contain 322 articles in English written by a journalist Daniel Pipes and translated into Hindi.\n\nEMILLE. This corpus (Baker et al., 2002) consists of three components: monolingual, parallel and annotated corpora. There are fourteen monolingual sub- corpora, including both written and (for some lan- guages) spoken data for fourteen South Asian lan- guages. The EMILLE monolingual corpora contain in total 92,799,000 words (including 2,627,000 words of transcribed spoken data for Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu). The parallel corpus consists of 200,000 words of text in English and its accompanying translations into Hindi and other languages.\n\nSmaller datasets as collected by Bojar et al. (2010) include the corpus used at ACL 2005 (a subcorpus of EMILLE), a corpus of named entities from Wikipedia (crawled in 2009), and Agriculture domain parallel corpus.\n\ufffc\nFor the current release, we are extending the parallel corpus using these sources:\nIntercorp (\u010cerm\u00e1k and Rosen,2012) is a large multilingual parallel corpus of 32 languages including Hindi. The central language used for alignment is Czech. Intercorp\u2019s core texts amount to 202 million words. These core texts are most suitable for us because their sentence alignment is manually checked and therefore very reliable. They cover predominately short sto- ries and novels. There are seven Hindi texts in Inter- corp. Unfortunately, only for three of them the English translation is available; the other four are aligned only with Czech texts. The Hindi subcorpus of Intercorp contains 118,000 words in Hindi.\n\nTED talks 3 held in various languages, primarily English, are equipped with transcripts and these are translated into 102 languages. There are 179 talks for which Hindi translation is available.\n\nThe Indic multi-parallel corpus (Birch et al., 2011; Post et al., 2012) is a corpus of texts from Wikipedia translated from the respective Indian language into English by non-expert translators hired over Mechanical Turk. The quality is thus somewhat mixed in many respects starting from typesetting and punctuation over capi- talization, spelling, word choice to sentence structure. A little bit of control could be in principle obtained from the fact that every input sentence was translated 4 times. We used the 2012 release of the corpus.\n\nLaunchpad.net is a software collaboration platform that hosts many open-source projects and facilitates also collaborative localization of the tools. We downloaded all revisions of all the hosted projects and extracted the localization (.po) files.\n\nOther smaller datasets.

Until now, most studies have focused on solving this problem of negativity in the English language, though the problem is much more than just harmful content. Furthermore, it is multilingual as well. Thus, we have constructed a Hope Speech dataset for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (HopeEDI) containing user-generated comments from the social media platform YouTube with 28,451, 20,198 and 10,705 comments in English, Tamil and Malayalam, respectively, manually labelled as containing hope speech or not. To our knowledge, this is the first research of its kind to annotate hope speech for equality, diversity and inclusion in a multilingual setting. We determined that the inter-annotator agreement of our dataset using Krippendorff{'}s alpha. Further, we created several baselines to benchmark the resulting dataset and the results have been expressed using precision, recall and F1-score. The dataset is publicly available for the research community. We hope that this resource will spur further research on encouraging inclusive and responsive speech that reinforces positiveness.\",\n}", "description": "A Hope Speech dataset for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (HopeEDI) containing user-generated comments from the social media platform YouTube with 28,451, 20,198 and 10,705 comments in English, Tamil and Malayalam, respectively, manually labelled as containing hope speech or not.", "downloads": 76, "paperswithcode_id": "hopeedi", "tags": ["task_categories:text-classification", "annotations_creators:expert-generated", "language_creators:crowdsourced", "multilinguality:monolingual", "multilinguality:multilingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:en", "language:ml", "language:ta", "license:cc-by-4.0", "size_categories:10K<n<100K", "region:us", "hope-speech-classification"], "createdAt": "2022-03-02T23:29:22.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "621ffdd236468d709f181e9a", "id": "SpellOnYou/kor_sarcasm", "author": "SpellOnYou", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-01-18T11:07:49.000Z", "likes": 3, "private": false, "sha": "8079d24b9f1278c6fbc992921c1271457a1064ff", "description": "This is a dataset designed to detect sarcasm in Korean because it distorts the literal meaning of a sentence\nand is highly related to sentiment classification.", "downloads": 76, "tags": ["task_categories:text-classification", "annotations_creators:expert-generated", "language_creators:found", "multilinguality:monolingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:ko", "license:mit", "size_categories:1K<n<10K", "region:us", "sarcasm-detection"], "createdAt": "2022-03-02T23:29:22.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "621ffdd236468d709f181eb8", "id": "facebook/mdd", "author": "facebook", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-01-18T11:08:49.000Z", "likes": 3, "private": false, "sha": "e72e9aa807c8d0925408d06e8a19934872e50f62", "citation": "@misc{dodge2016evaluating,\n      title={Evaluating Prerequisite Qualities for Learning End-to-End Dialog Systems},\n      author={Jesse Dodge and Andreea Gane and Xiang Zhang and Antoine Bordes and Sumit Chopra and Alexander Miller and Arthur Szlam and Jason Weston},\n      year={2016},\n      eprint={1511.06931},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL}\n}", "description": "The Movie Dialog dataset (MDD) is designed to measure how well\nmodels can perform at goal and non-goal orientated dialog\ncentered around the topic of movies (question answering,\nrecommendation and discussion).", "downloads": 76, "paperswithcode_id": "mdd", "tags": ["task_categories:text-generation", "task_categories:fill-mask", "task_ids:dialogue-modeling", "annotations_creators:no-annotation", "language_creators:found", "multilinguality:monolingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:en", "license:cc-by-3.0", "size_categories:100K<n<1M", "arxiv:1511.06931", "region:us"], "createdAt": "2022-03-02T23:29:22.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "621ffdd236468d709f181ef5", "id": "ltgoslo/norne", "author": "ltgoslo", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-01-18T11:10:44.000Z", "likes": 1, "private": false, "sha": "e977ad72686ce377f3bf11473a183041a77cf6ec", "citation": "@inproceedings{johansen2019ner,\n  title={NorNE: Annotating Named Entities for Norwegian},\n  author={Fredrik J\u00f8rgensen, Tobias Aasmoe, Anne-Stine Ruud Husev\u00e5g,\n          Lilja \u00d8vrelid, and Erik Velldal},\n  booktitle={LREC 2020},\n  year={2020},\n  url={https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12146}\n}", "description": "NorNE is a manually annotated\ncorpus of named entities which extends the annotation of the existing\nNorwegian Dependency Treebank.

In this work, we build a customized sentence segmenter for Bengali and propose two novel methods for parallel corpus creation on low-resource setups: aligner ensembling and batch filtering. With the segmenter and the two methods combined, we compile a high-quality Bengali-English parallel corpus comprising of 2.75 million sentence pairs, more than 2 million of which were not available before. Training on neural models, we achieve an improvement of more than 9 BLEU score over previous approaches to Bengali-English machine translation. We also evaluate on a new test set of 1000 pairs made with extensive quality control. We release the segmenter, parallel corpus, and the evaluation set, thus elevating Bengali from its low-resource status. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever large scale study on Bengali-English machine translation.

Track 2 of 2018\nn2c2 shared tasks focused on the extraction of medications, with their signature\ninformation, and adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical narratives.\nThis track built on our previous medication challenge, but added a special focus on ADEs.\n\nADEs are injuries resulting from a medical intervention related to a drugs and\ncan include allergic reactions, drug interactions, overdoses, and medication errors.\nCollectively, ADEs are estimated to account for 30% of all hospital adverse\nevents; however, ADEs are preventable. Identifying potential drug interactions,\noverdoses, allergies, and errors at the point of care and alerting the caregivers of\npotential ADEs can improve health delivery, reduce the risk of ADEs, and improve health\noutcomes.\n\nA step in this direction requires processing narratives of clinical records\nthat often elaborate on the medications given to a patient, as well as the known\nallergies, reactions, and adverse events of the patient. Extraction of this information\nfrom narratives complements the structured medication information that can be\nobtained from prescriptions, allowing a more thorough assessment of potential ADEs\nbefore they happen.\n\nThe 2018 n2c2 shared task Track 2, hereon referred to as the ADE track,\ntackled these natural language processing tasks in 3 different steps,\nwhich we refer to as tasks:\n1.
