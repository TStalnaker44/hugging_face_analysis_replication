Unlike recently released datasets, such as DeepMind\nCNN/DailyMail and SQuAD, the proposed SearchQA was constructed to reflect a full pipeline of general question-answering. That is, we start not from an existing article\nand generate a question-answer pair, but start from an existing question-answer pair, crawled from J! Archive, and augment it with text snippets retrieved by Google.\nFollowing this approach, we built SearchQA, which consists of more than 140k question-answer pairs with each pair having 49.6 snippets on average. Each question-answer-context\n tuple of the SearchQA comes with additional meta-data such as the snippet's URL, which we believe will be valuable resources for future research. We conduct human evaluation\n as well as test two baseline methods, one simple word selection and the other deep learning based, on the SearchQA. We show that there is a meaningful gap between the human\n and machine performances.

To further expand KGs{'} coverage, previous studies on knowledge graph completion usually require a large number of positive examples for each relation. However, we observe long-tail relations are actually more common in KGs and those newly added relations often do not have many known triples for training. In this work, we aim at predicting new facts under a challenging setting where only one training instance is available. We propose a one-shot relational learning framework, which utilizes the knowledge distilled by embedding models and learns a matching metric by considering both the learned embeddings and one-hop graph structures. Empirically, our model yields considerable performance improvements over existing embedding models, and also eliminates the need of re-training the embedding models when dealing with newly added relations.\",\n}", "description": "NELL-one for relational similarity", "downloads": 102, "tags": ["multilinguality:monolingual", "language:en", "license:other", "size_categories:n<1K", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-02-01T18:24:45.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "63f985dcb9b235a9d2fd9ab6", "id": "gokuls/wiki_book_corpus_complete_raw_dataset", "author": "gokuls", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-02-25T03:58:51.000Z", "likes": 0, "private": false, "sha": "142f48624088ac150dd80345decb21a82a6c21ee", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for \"wiki_book_corpus_complete_raw_dataset\"\n\t\n\nMore Information needed\n", "downloads": 102, "tags": ["size_categories:10M<n<100M", "format:parquet", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:dask", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-02-25T03:51:56.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "6435483fa9265d9aaf8cb27e", "id": "tasksource/ScienceQA_text_only", "author": "tasksource", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-07-13T11:50:29.000Z", "likes": 22, "private": false, "sha": "37ca6a0e9f35a7002e46afe5c2bbc047c7c3598f", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for \"scienceQA_text_only\"\n\t\n\nScienceQA text-only examples (examples where no image was initially present, which means they should be doable with text-only models.)\n@article{10.1007/s00799-022-00329-y,\nauthor = {Saikh, Tanik and Ghosal, Tirthankar and Mittal, Amish and Ekbal, Asif and Bhattacharyya, Pushpak},\ntitle = {ScienceQA: A Novel Resource for Question Answering on Scholarly Articles},\nyear = {2022},\njournal = {Int.

Our baseline models perform poorly on this task (55.4{\\%}) and significantly lag behind human performance (93.5{\\%}).\",\r\n}", "downloads": 101, "tags": ["license:mit", "size_categories:1M<n<10M", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-01-26T07:34:36.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "64253a439c641fcd460cf585", "id": "Chinese-Vicuna/guanaco_belle_merge_v1.0", "author": "Chinese-Vicuna", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-03-30T07:49:30.000Z", "likes": 89, "private": false, "sha": "a46f98219e858c49500688be011861712b6d9f31", "description": "Thanks for Guanaco Dataset and Belle Dataset\nThis dataset was created by merging the above two datasets in a certain format so that they can be used for training our code Chinese-Vicuna\n", "downloads": 101, "tags": ["language:zh", "language:en", "language:ja", "license:gpl-3.0", "size_categories:100K<n<1M", "format:json", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-03-30T07:29:07.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "64269f9e3a5fefd7f59eaa7e", "id": "BelleGroup/train_1M_CN", "author": "BelleGroup", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-04-03T08:23:17.000Z", "likes": 130, "private": false, "sha": "a8b4ee0a0a828c8568f74b1c0e09b1367af2d8d6", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\u5185\u5bb9\n\t\n\n\u5305\u542b\u7ea6100\u4e07\u6761\u7531BELLE\u9879\u76ee\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u3002\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\u6837\u4f8b\n\t\n\n{\n  \"instruction\": \"\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u5b57\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u52a01\u3002\\n\u201c\u660e\u5929\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae\u57289\u70b9\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f97\u51c6\u65f6\u5230\u8fbe\u3002\u201d\\n\",\n  \"input\": \"\",\n  \"output\": \"\u201c\u660e\u5929\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae\u572810\u70b9\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f97\u51c6\u65f6\u5230\u8fbe\u3002\u201d\"\n}\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\u5b57\u6bb5\uff1a\n\t\n\ninstruction: \u6307\u4ee4\ninput: \u8f93\u5165\uff08\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5747\u4e3a\u7a7a\uff09\noutput: \u8f93\u51fa\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\u4f7f\u7528\u9650\u5236\n\t\n\n\u4ec5\u5141\u8bb8\u5c06\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u884d\u751f\u7269\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u7528\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u4f1a\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u5371\u5bb3\u7684\u7528\u9014\u3002\n\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u65b9\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u3001\u5229\u76ca\u6216\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u5173\u4efb\u4f55\u56e2\u4f53\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002\u56e0\u4f7f\u7528\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u635f\u5bb3\u3001\u7ea0\u7eb7\uff0c\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u4e0d\u627f\u62c5\u4efb\u4f55\u8d23\u4efb\u3002\n", "downloads": 101, "tags": ["task_categories:text2text-generation", "language:zh", "license:gpl-3.0", "size_categories:100K<n<1M", "format:json", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us", "croissant"], "createdAt": "2023-03-31T08:53:50.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "642912f7a760fe0bf37996b1", "id": "anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered", "author": "anon8231489123", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2023-04-12T05:23:59.000Z", "likes": 701, "private": false, "sha": "192ab2185289094fc556ec8ce5ce1e8e587154ca", "description": "Further cleaning done.

The paradigm\npretrains a shared model on large volumes of unlabeled data and achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for various tasks with minimal adaptation. However, the\nspeech processing community lacks a similar setup to systematically explore the\nparadigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce Speech processing Universal\nPERformance Benchmark (SUPERB). SUPERB is a leaderboard to benchmark the\nperformance of a shared model across a wide range of speech processing tasks\nwith minimal architecture changes and labeled data. Among multiple usages of the\nshared model, we especially focus on extracting the representation learned from\nSSL due to its preferable re-usability. We present a simple framework to solve\nSUPERB tasks by learning task-specialized lightweight prediction heads on top of\nthe frozen shared model.

The performance of the dialogue system has been improved recently by the method utilizing dialogue-related knowledge; however, non-English dialogue systems suffer from reproducing the performance of English dialogue systems because securing knowledge in the same language with the dialogue system is relatively difficult. Through experiments with a Korean dialogue system, this paper proves that the performance of a non-English dialogue system can be improved by utilizing English knowledge, highlighting the system uses cross-lingual knowledge. For the experiments, we 1) constructed a Korean version of the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset, 2) built Korean-English T5 (KE-T5), a language model pre-trained with Korean and English corpus, and 3) developed a knowledge-grounded Korean dialogue model based on KE-T5. We observed the performance improvement in the open-domain Korean dialogue model even only English knowledge was given. The experimental results showed that the knowledge inherent in cross-lingual language models can be helpful for generating responses in open dialogue systems.\",\n}", "description": "# KoWoW: Korean

To successfully cope with it, machine learning are applied. However, ML-based techniques require sufficiently large annotated datasets. In the last years, different datasets were published, mainly for English. In this paper, we present a new dataset for Portuguese, which has not been in focus so far. The dataset is composed of 5,668 tweets. For its annotation, we defined two different schemes used by annotators with different levels of expertise. Firstly, non-experts annotated the tweets with binary labels ({`}hate{'} vs. {`}no-hate{'}). Secondly, expert annotators classified the tweets following a fine-grained hierarchical multiple label scheme with 81 hate speech categories in total. The inter-annotator agreement varied from category to category, which reflects the insight that some types of hate speech are more subtle than others and that their detection depends on personal perception. This hierarchical annotation scheme is the main contribution of the presented work, as it facilitates the identification of different types of hate speech and their intersections. To demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset, we carried a baseline classification experiment with pre-trained word embeddings and LSTM on the binary classified data, with a state-of-the-art outcome.\",\n}", "description": "Portuguese dataset for hate speech detection composed of 5,668 tweets with binary annotations (i.e. 'hate' vs. 'no-hate').", "downloads": 96, "tags": ["task_categories:text-classification", "annotations_creators:expert-generated", "language_creators:found", "multilinguality:monolingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:pt", "license:unknown", "size_categories:1K<n<10K", "region:us", "hate-speech-detection"], "createdAt": "2022-03-02T23:29:22.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "621ffdd236468d709f181ee6", "id": "nwu-ctext/nchlt", "author": "nwu-ctext", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-01-18T11:10:13.000Z", "likes": 5, "private": false, "sha": "0df99f2a81059e8a5785f9e80e70c8474faa564e", "citation": "@inproceedings{eiselen2014developing,\n  title={Developing Text Resources for Ten South African Languages.},\n  author={Eiselen, Roald and Puttkammer, Martin J},\n  booktitle={LREC},\n  pages={3698--3703},\n  year={2014}\n}", "description": "The development of linguistic resources for use in natural language processingis of utmost importance for the continued growth of research anddevelopment in the field, especially for resource-scarce languages.

The project focussed on establishing a set of foundational resources that can foster further development of both resources and technologies for the NLP industry in South Africa. The development efforts during the project included creating monolingual unannotated corpora, of which a subset of the corpora for each language was annotated on token, orthographic, morphological and morphosyntactic layers. The annotated subsetsincludes both development and test setsand were used in the creation of five core-technologies, viz. atokeniser, sentenciser,lemmatiser, part of speech tagger and morphological decomposer for each language. We report on the quality of these tools for each language and provide some more context of the importance of the resources within the South African context.", "downloads": 96, "tags": ["task_categories:token-classification", "task_ids:named-entity-recognition", "annotations_creators:expert-generated", "language_creators:expert-generated", "multilinguality:multilingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:af", "language:nr", "language:nso", "language:ss", "language:tn", "language:ts", "language:ve", "language:xh", "language:zu", "license:cc-by-2.5", "size_categories:1K<n<10K", "region:us"], "createdAt": "2022-03-02T23:29:22.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "621ffdd236468d709f181f49", "id": "textmachinelab/quail", "author": "textmachinelab", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-01-04T16:18:32.000Z", "likes": 5, "private": false, "sha": "2bd9d7f90a532fe1a910b70972cef5fda341c8fe", "description": "\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Card for \"quail\"\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDataset Summary\n\t\n\nQuAIL is a  reading comprehension dataset.

Lack of facial expressions and voice modulations make detecting emotions in text a challenging problem. For instance, as humans, on reading ''Why don't you ever text me!'' we can either interpret it as a sad or angry emotion and the same ambiguity exists for machines. However, the context of dialogue can prove helpful in detection of the emotion. In this task, given a textual dialogue i.e. an utterance along with two previous turns of context, the goal was to infer the underlying emotion of the utterance by choosing from four emotion classes - Happy, Sad, Angry and Others. To facilitate the participation in this task, textual dialogues from user interaction with a conversational agent were taken and annotated for emotion classes after several data processing steps. A training data set of 30160 dialogues, and two evaluation data sets, Test1 and Test2, containing 2755 and 5509 dialogues respectively were released to the participants. A total of 311 teams made submissions to this task. The final leader-board was evaluated on Test2 data set, and the highest ranked submission achieved 79.59 micro-averaged F1 score. Our analysis of systems submitted to the task indicate that Bi-directional LSTM was the most common choice of neural architecture used, and most of the systems had the best performance for the Sad emotion class, and the worst for the Happy emotion class}\n}", "description": "In this dataset, given a textual dialogue i.e. an utterance along with two previous turns of context, the goal was to infer the underlying emotion of the utterance by choosing from four emotion classes - Happy, Sad, Angry and Others.", "downloads": 94, "paperswithcode_id": "emocontext", "tags": ["task_categories:text-classification", "task_ids:sentiment-classification", "annotations_creators:expert-generated", "language_creators:crowdsourced", "multilinguality:monolingual", "source_datasets:original", "language:en", "license:unknown", "size_categories:10K<n<100K", "region:us"], "createdAt": "2022-03-02T23:29:22.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "621ffdd236468d709f181e6c", "id": "iapp/iapp_wiki_qa_squad", "author": "iapp", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-01-18T11:05:58.000Z", "likes": 5, "private": false, "sha": "c88fa968aef60653649a37eb617d220f9ff5f470", "citation": "@dataset{kobkrit_viriyayudhakorn_2021_4539916,\n  author       = {Kobkrit Viriyayudhakorn and\n                  Charin Polpanumas},\n  title        = {iapp_wiki_qa_squad},\n  month        = feb,\n  year         = 2021,\n  publisher    = {Zenodo},\n  version      = 1,\n  doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.4539916},\n  url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4539916}\n}", "description": "`iapp_wiki_qa_squad` is an extractive question answering dataset from Thai Wikipedia articles.\nIt is adapted from [the original iapp-wiki-qa-dataset](https://github.com/iapp-technology/iapp-wiki-qa-dataset)\nto [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) format, resulting in\n5761/742/739 questions from 1529/191/192 articles.", "downloads": 94, "tags": ["task_categories:question-answering", "task_ids:extractive-qa", "task_ids:open-domain-qa", "annotations_creators:expert-generated", "language_creators:found", "multilinguality:monolingual", "source_datasets:extended|other-iapp-wiki-qa-dataset", "language:th", "license:mit", "size_categories:1K<n<10K", "region:us"], "createdAt": "2022-03-02T23:29:22.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "626214ab8fd541272cff629a", "id": "adithya7/xlel_wd_dictionary", "author": "adithya7", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2022-07-01T17:30:21.000Z", "likes": 3, "private": false, "sha": "996e72dea151ca0856d1d16efd71f560b18da817", "citation": "@article{pratapa-etal-2022-multilingual,\ntitle = {Multilingual Event Linking to Wikidata},\nauthor = {Pratapa, Adithya and Gupta, Rishubh and Mitamura, Teruko},\npublisher = {arXiv},\nyear = {2022},\nurl = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06535},\n}", "description": "XLEL-WD is a multilingual event linking dataset.

The CAS corpus contains clinical cases published in scientific literature and training material. They are published in different journals from French-speaking countries (France, Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, African countries, tropical countries) and are related to various medical specialties (cardiology, urology, oncology, obstetrics, pulmonology, gastro-enterology). The purpose of clinical cases is to describe clinical situations of patients. Hence, their content is close to the content of clinical narratives (description of diagnoses, treatments or procedures, evolution, family history, expected audience, etc.). In clinical cases, the negation is frequently used for describing the patient signs, symptoms, and diagnosis.

However, low-resource languages are mostly left out in these datasets. This is primarily because many widely spoken languages that are not well represented on the web and therefore excluded from the large-scale crawls for datasets. Furthermore, downstream users of these models are restricted to the selection of languages originally chosen for pre-training. This work investigates how to optimally leverage existing pre-trained models to create low-resource translation systems for 16 African languages. We focus on two questions: 1) How can pre-trained models be used for languages not included in the initial pretraining? and 2) How can the resulting translation models effectively transfer to new domains? To answer these questions, we create a novel African news corpus covering 16 languages, of which eight languages are not part of any existing evaluation dataset. We demonstrate that the most effective strategy for transferring both additional languages and additional domains is to leverage small quantities of high-quality translation data to fine-tune large pre-trained models.\",\n}", "description": "MAFAND-MT is the largest MT benchmark for African languages in the news domain, covering 21 languages.

This is an obstacle to progress in other languages. Unfortunately, obtaining new annotated resources for each task in each language would be prohibitively expensive. At the same time, commercial machine translation systems are now robust. Can we leverage these systems to translate English-language datasets automatically? In this paper, we offer a positive response for natural language inference (NLI) in Turkish. We translated two large English NLI datasets into Turkish and had a team of experts validate their translation quality and fidelity to the original labels. Using these datasets, we address core issues of representation for Turkish NLI. We find that in-language embeddings are essential and that morphological parsing can be avoided where the training set is large. Finally, we show that models trained on our machine-translated datasets are successful on human-translated evaluation sets. We share all code, models, and data publicly.\",\n}", "description": "The Natural Language Inference in Turkish (NLI-TR) is a set of two large scale datasets that were obtained by translating the foundational NLI corpora (SNLI and MNLI) using Amazon Translate.", "downloads": 88, "paperswithcode_id": "nli-tr", "tags": ["task_categories:text-classification", "task_ids:natural-language-inference", "task_ids:semantic-similarity-scoring", "task_ids:text-scoring", "annotations_creators:expert-generated", "language_creators:machine-generated", "multilinguality:monolingual", "source_datasets:extended|snli", "source_datasets:extended|multi_nli", "language:tr", "license:cc-by-3.0", "license:cc-by-4.0", "license:cc-by-sa-3.0", "license:mit", "license:other", "size_categories:100K<n<1M", "region:us"], "createdAt": "2022-03-02T23:29:22.000Z", "key": ""}, {"_id": "621ffdd236468d709f182009", "id": "gboleda/wikicorpus", "author": "gboleda", "disabled": false, "gated": false, "lastModified": "2024-01-18T11:18:14.000Z", "likes": 9, "private": false, "sha": "5eef3045e6e2eb495f5d3006122a46cfb6bd843c", "citation": "@inproceedings{reese-etal-2010-wikicorpus,\n    title = \"{W}ikicorpus: A Word-Sense Disambiguated Multilingual {W}ikipedia Corpus\",\n    author = \"Reese, Samuel  and\n      Boleda, Gemma  and\n      Cuadros, Montse  and\n      Padr{\\'o}, Llu{\\'i}s  and\n      Rigau, German\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}'10)\",\n    month = may,\n    year = \"2010\",\n    address = \"Valletta, Malta\",\n    publisher = \"European Language Resources Association (ELRA)\",\n    url = \"http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2010/pdf/222_Paper.pdf\",\n    abstract = \"This article presents a new freely available trilingual corpus (Catalan, Spanish, English) that contains large portions of the Wikipedia and has been automatically enriched with linguistic information. To our knowledge, this is the largest such corpus that is freely available to the community: In its present version, it contains over 750 million words. The corpora have been annotated with lemma and part of speech information using the open source library FreeLing. Also, they have been sense annotated with the state of the art Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm UKB. As UKB assigns WordNet senses, and WordNet has been aligned across languages via the InterLingual Index, this sort of annotation opens the way to massive explorations in lexical semantics that were not possible before. We present a first attempt at creating a trilingual lexical resource from the sense-tagged Wikipedia corpora, namely, WikiNet. Moreover, we present two by-products of the project that are of use for the NLP community: An open source Java-based parser for Wikipedia pages developed for the construction of the corpus, and the integration of the WSD algorithm UKB in FreeLing.\",\n}", "description": "The Wikicorpus is a trilingual corpus (Catalan, Spanish, English) that contains large portions of the Wikipedia (based on a 2006 dump) and has been automatically enriched with linguistic information.
